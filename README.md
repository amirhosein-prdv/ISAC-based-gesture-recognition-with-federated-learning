# ISAC-based-gesture-recognition-with-federated-learning

Decentralized sensing framework for ISAC-based gesture recognition systems with real Wi-Fi dataset (WIDAR 3.0)

In this repository, I implemented *FedAvg*, *FedProx* and *FedADMM* algorithms with Pytorch framework.
I also robust the models against adversarial attack with some adversarial methods like SAM, FGSM, Poisoning attacks, Evasion atttacks and etc.

The model used in this algorithms is based on this paper:

Y. Zhu, R. Zhang, Y. Cui, S. Wu, C. Jiang and X. Jing, "Communication-Efficient Personalized Federated Edge Learning for Decentralized Sensing in ISAC," 2023 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops), Rome, Italy, 2023, pp. 207-212, doi: 10.1109/ICCWorkshops57953.2023.10283763.

You can use your own models and datasets with these algorithms.
