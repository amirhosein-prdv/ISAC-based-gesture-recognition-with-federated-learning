# ISAC-based-gesture-recognition-with-federated-learning

Decentralized sensing framework for ISAC-based gesture recognition systems with real Wi-Fi dataset (WIDAR 3.0)

In this repository, I implemented *FedAvg*, *Fedprox* and *FedADMM* algorithms with Pytorch and also robust the models with some adversarial methods like SAM, Fedrobust and etc.
