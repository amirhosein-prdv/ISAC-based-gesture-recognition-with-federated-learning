# ISAC-based-gesture-recognition-with-federated-learning

Decentralized sensing framework for ISAC-based gesture recognition systems with real Wi-Fi dataset (WIDAR 3.0)

In this repository, I implemented *FedAvg*, *FedProx* and *FedADMM* algorithms with Pytorch framework and also robust the models with some adversarial methods like SAM,poisoning attack, FedRobust and etc.
